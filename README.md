# MuSiCaL - a Music Synthesis Coding Language

**MSCL** (aka **M**u**S**i**C**a**L**) is a library that allows you to synthesize music using basic commands, somewhat similar to MML (Music Macro Language).

This project is a means for me to learn and experiment with various Audio APIs (e.g. XAudio2).
