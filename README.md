# MuSiCaL - a Music Synthesis Coding Language

This project is a means for me to learn and experiment with various Audio APIs (e.g. XAudio2).

## MSCL
MSCL is a C library that allows you to synthesize music using basic commands written in code, somewhat similar to MML (Music Macro Language).

## MSCL-Player
MSCL-Player is C++ Library that allows you to play MSCL Songs and visualize waveforms via a GUI interface.

## MSCL-Demo
MSCL-Demo is a C++ Application that demonstrates how to use the above two libraries.
